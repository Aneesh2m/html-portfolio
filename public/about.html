<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Aneesh M.I am currently a third-year student at the National Institute of Technology, Warangal, pursuing a Bachelor of Technology degree in Biotechnology. 
  Throughout my academic journey,
   I have developed a deep passion for biotechnology and its potential to revolutionize various sectors. However, my interests extend beyond the realm of biotechnology alone.</p>

<p>One of my strongest interests lies in learning new technologies and exploring their applications.
   I firmly believe that embracing technology is essential in today's fast-paced world. To complement 
   my biotechnology studies, I have delved into areas such as programming, web development, DevOps, and 
   graphic design..</p>


<p>I am excited to explore the synergies between these
   fields and apply my multidimensional skills to make a meaningful impact.</p>
